# SMS - Store Management System
This was a school assignment to learn REST API, frontend, backend, and javascript<br/>
It is a simple management system for stores and stock.

To setup, go to main folder
- Install with: `npm install` 
- Start server with: `nodemon index` 
- Open a browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

Note that there are no product images at the moment, to add an image you have to manually upload them into `/frontend/images/`<br/>
When that is done you can update the product and set the name of the image file to `images/*`
